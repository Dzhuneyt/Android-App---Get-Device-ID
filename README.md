# Android-Find-Device-ID

Source code of the Android app you can [download from here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasmobi.find.device.id). The app is very simple and allows you to see the "internal device ID" that is a unique alphanumeric string given to each Android device by its manufacturer.
